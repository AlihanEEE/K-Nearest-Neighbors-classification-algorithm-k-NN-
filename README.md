# K-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm

## Introduction
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm in C++. k-NN is a simple, yet powerful, machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies data points based on the majority vote of their neighbors, with the data point being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors.

## Installation
Clone the repository and compile the source code using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.

git clone https://github.com/AlihanEEE/cpp-K-Nearest-Neighbors-classification-algorithm-k-NN-
cd cpp-K-Nearest-Neighbors-classification-algorithm-k-NN-
g++ -o knn main.cpp

## Usage
To run the k-NN algorithm, execute the compiled program and follow the on-screen prompts to input your data set and parameters.
